Bugs fixed in Course.java:
1. getCourseLocation method was returning instructorName. Fixed to return courseLocation
2. getInstructorName method was returning courseLocation. Fixed to return instructorName
3. enrolledStudentCount was being initialized to 500 in the constructor. Fixed to initialize to 0.
4. isCourseFull method was returning true when the enrollmentCapacity was greater than the
enrolledStudentCount. Fixed to return true when the enrollmentCapacity is less than or equal to
the enrolledStudentCount.
5. Static Analyzer name: MissingOverride. toString method was missing override annotation. 
Fixed to add @Override annotation.

count has been incremented if the course can accomodate an additional student. Returns false
otherwise, as is indicated in the comment.
